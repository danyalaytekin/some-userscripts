# Some UserScripts

This repo will assemble some simple UserScripts written for Safari, in particular Safari running the [UserScripts extension by Justin Wasack](https://github.com/quoid/userscripts).

## Notes for myself

- The UserScripts app:
    - checks for the same kind of front-matter at `@updateURL` as is present in a script, so this URL might as well be the same as `@downloadURL`, unless the script becomes very large
    - doesn't pick up JS scripts with front matter written as `/* {front matter} */` instead of `// front matter`; I don't know whether this is a general rule affecting all clients
        - it's fine with CSS files doing this

### How to... CSS â†’ JS

#### `some-userstyle.css`

```css
/* ==UserStyle==
@name           Some UserStyle
...
==/UserStyle== */

body {
    display: none;
}
```

#### `some-userscript.js`

```js
// ==UserScript==
// @name           Some UserScript
// @grant          GM.addStyle
// ...
// ==/UserScript==

GM.addStyle(`
    body {
        display: none;
    }
`)
```
